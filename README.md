# Prolific PL2303 

## Overview

The PL2303 USB to Serial adapter is widely used for connecting various serial devices. However, users have reported issues with the PL2303 drivers on newer versions of Windows, which may prevent proper communication between the adapter and connected devices. This README provides a brief overview of the problem and a solution using an older driver.

### Types of Cables Using PL2303 Chipset

1. **USB to Serial Adapters**
   - **Uses**: Connecting to network switches, routers, and firewalls for console access; connecting to barcode scanners, CNC machines, and industrial equipment; and programming ham radios for firmware updates, frequency memory and digital mode operation.
   - **Common Connectors**: USB Type-A, USB Type-B, DB9, DB25.

2. **USB to TTL Serial Cables**
   - **Uses**: Programming microcontrollers (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi) and connecting to SDR (Software Defined Radio) setups in ham radio projects; also used for debugging embedded systems.
   - **Common Connectors**: USB Type-A, 0.1" (2.54mm) header, Jumper wires.

3. **USB to RS-232 Cables**
   - **Uses**: Connecting to legacy networking devices (e.g., older modems, serial print servers) and older ham radios for programming and interfacing with control software; also used for connecting serial printers and some legacy computers.
   - **Common Connectors**: USB Type-A, DB9, DB25.

4. **USB to RS-485/RS-422 Adapters**
   - **Uses**: Connecting to industrial network devices (e.g., PLCs) and certain ham radio digital mode interfaces or remote control systems; often used in automation applications and for remote sensor communication.
   - **Common Connectors**: USB Type-A, DB9, terminal blocks, RJ45.

## Problem

With the release of newer Windows versions, particularly Windows 10 and Windows 11, many users have encountered difficulties when using PL2303-based USB to Serial adapters. Common issues include:

- **Device Not Recognized**: The PL2303 adapter may not be detected by the operating system.
- **Inconsistent Data Transmission**: Users may experience corrupted or garbled data when communicating through the adapter.
- **Driver Conflicts**: Newer Windows updates may install incompatible drivers, leading to device malfunctions.

These issues can hinder the use of essential devices that rely on serial communication, such as GPS units, microcontrollers, and legacy equipment. This issue is compounded by the market being flooded with counterfeit chipsets.

## Solution

To resolve these issues, I recommend using an older version of the PL2303 driver. The driver file named `P3200.exe` has been identified as a reliable solution for ensuring proper functionality with PL2303 adapters on newer Windows systems.

### Installation Steps

1. **Download the Driver**: Obtain the `P3200.exe` file from this repository.
   
2. **Update Driver in Device Manager**:
   - Open Device Manager (search for it in the Start menu).
   - Locate the PL2303 device under "Ports (COM & LPT)" or "Universal Serial Bus controllers".
   - Right-click on the device and select "Update driver".
   - Choose "Browse my computer for drivers".
   - Click on "Let me pick from a list of available drivers on my computer".
   - Select the oldest driver available if no drivers are found continue to next steps.
   - Uncheck "Show compatible hardware" to view all drivers.
   - Look for the Prolific driver from 2007 in the list and select it.

3. **Complete the Installation**: Follow the on-screen instructions to finish updating the driver.

4. **Reconnect the PL2303 Adapter**: After the installation, reconnect your PL2303 adapter to your computer. Windows should recognize the device and establish a proper connection.

5. **Test the Connection**: Use a terminal program or the device's software to test the communication and ensure everything is functioning as expected.

## Conclusion

If you encounter issues with your PL2303 USB to Serial adapter on newer Windows versions, using the older driver `P3200.exe` is a recommended solution. This workaround has successfully resolved problems for many users, allowing for reliable communication with serial devices.
